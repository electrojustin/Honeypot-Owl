Honeypot Owl
An implementation of the O'RLY Owl seen in this video:

Mess with hackers on your honeypot by triggering the owl when they attempt to
run certain applications.

Compilation:
Compilation should be as simple as "make" on most machines.

Installation:
Descretely hide the shared object generated from compilation. Then, change 
the LD_PRELOAD environmental variable to the full path of the shared object.
I'd recommend putting "export LD_PRELOAD=/your/path/here/orly.so" in the
.bash_profile of the honeypot's user.

You can modify the list of preapproved applications by editing the 
"preapproved" array in the source file.
